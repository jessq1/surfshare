# surfshare
A full-stack Django App - Surf Share
1. __Getting Started:__<br>

   <em> A Surf Board Sharing System that provide economic solutions for both board owners and renters.</em><br>

   Surf Board rental typically cost $25 for half a day or $40 per-day. While Board storage near the beach usually cost $80 per month. It is a great expanse for surfing enthusiasts. SurfShare provides a platform to share this expanse between board owner and renter. To enter the Board Share System, every user pays a relatively low monthly membership fee ($30). In exchange, a board renter will pay a much lower rental fee each time. 80% of this rental fee will go to the board owner.
